# my-first-full-stack-project

This is my first full stack web project. The purpose is to create a simple website that makes use of several different frameworks and concepts to learn about backend web development. The following tools were used in this project:
- Python
- Flask
- HTML

## Getting Started
To run the website on local follow the following steps on macOS. 

### Create an Environment
Once you're within the directory, you'll need to create a ```venv``` folder within.
```
$ python -m venv venv
```

### Activate the Environment
```
$ . venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Flask
```
$ pip install Flask
```
Flask is now installed. 

### Run the Web Server
To run the web server, simply run main.py. From the console:
```
$ python main.py
```

You will receive a response that looks like this:
```
 * Serving Flask app 'website' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
